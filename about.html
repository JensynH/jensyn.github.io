            <p>
                Hello! I'm Jensyn Huynh, and I'm a Computer Science major in Texas A&M with a background in fashion
                design and animation.
                I hold a strong belief that art is indispensible, so I started my academic career in the art field. But
                as I delved deeper,
                I realized I wanted to develop art programs rather than doing actual art. This led me down the
                rabbithole of technology,
                and I became more and more fascinated by it.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since making the switch to Computer Science, I have immersed myself in learning programming languages
                such as Python, Java,
                and C++. There were definitely challenges as I had absolutely no experience compared to my peers. But
                through these challenges,
                I learned that I am just as capable as any other computer scientist and grown a lot during my years as a
                student. I am driven
                by a desire to create tools that artists can use to express their creativity and add even more art into
                the world.
