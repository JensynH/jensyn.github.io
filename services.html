            <div class="quest-description">
                I volunteered as an art instructor at my former elementary school, where I designed and led creative art
                lessons for young students.
                My role involved developing engaging lesson plans, introducing foundational art concepts, and guiding
                children through various
                artistic techniques and projects. Through this experience, I aimed to foster creativity, encourage
                self-expression, and build
                confidence in the students. It was a rewarding opportunity to give back to the school community that
                shaped my own early education,
                while also helping to inspire a new generation of young artists.

            <div class="quest-description">
                As a contributing sculptor for the Ernie Banks statue project at Booker T. Washington HSPVA, I had the
                unique opportunity to sculpt
                the shoes of the statue. This work was part of a larger collaborative effort to honor the legendary
                Chicago Cubs player and celebrate
                his enduring legacy in sports and culture. The experience taught me the value of teamwork in a creative
                context and reinforced my
                belief in the power of public art to foster community spirit and preserve cultural heritage. By
                sculpting part of this iconic statue,
                I was able to give back to the community through art and contribute to a piece that stands as a
                testament to perseverance, hope, and
                excellence.

                I donated original dog drawings to support a fundraising initiative for Operation Kindness, a leading
                no-kill animal shelter. The artwork
                was created specifically to help raise awareness and funds for the organization's mission of providing
                care and finding homes for homeless
                pets. By contributing my artistic skills to this cause, I aimed to engage the community and encourage
                donations through visually appealing
                and heartfelt illustrations. This experience allowed me to leverage my creativity in a meaningful way,
                supporting a cause I am passionate
                about and contributing to the welfare of animals in need.

            <div class="quest-description">
                I contributed two large-scale chalk pieces to the Arty for the Planet project at the Lacerte Family Zoo,
                a creative initiative that raised
                awareness about environmental conservation through art. These pieces were designed to engage viewers,
                featuring vibrant depictions of
                endangered species and their habitats. By using art as a medium to convey a powerful message, I aimed to
                inspire a deeper connection
                between people and the natural world, bringing more attention to the need for conservation efforts. This
                experience allowed me to use my
                artistic skills to contribute to a cause I am passionate about and to bring visibility to environmental
                issues in a dynamic and accessible
                way.
